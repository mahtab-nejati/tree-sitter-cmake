# A Better Tree-sitter Parser for CMake

This repository provides an accurate `CMake` parser.
Up until August 10th, 2024, the parser has been tested on over 10,000 commits that modify `CMake` build specifications with no errors.
It has been improved to successfully parse all supported syntax in `CMake` based on its [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html\#syntax).
